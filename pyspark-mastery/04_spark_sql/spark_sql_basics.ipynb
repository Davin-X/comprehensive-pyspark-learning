    "## 🎯 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Learned:\n",
    "- ✅ **`spark.sql()`** - Execute SQL queries on DataFrames\n",
    "- ✅ **`createOrReplaceTempView()`** - Register DataFrames as SQL tables\n",
    "- ✅ **SQL functions** - String, math, date, and aggregate functions\n",
    "- ✅ **Joins in SQL** - INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER joins\n",
    "- ✅ **Complex queries** - CTEs, subqueries, window functions\n",
    "- ✅ **SQL + DataFrame mixing** - Best of both worlds\n",
    "- ✅ **Performance optimization** - SQL vs DataFrame API comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Capabilities in Spark:\n",
    "- 🔸 **Standard SQL** - SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY\n",
    "- 🔸 **Joins** - All major join types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)\n",
    "- 🔸 **Subqueries** - Nested queries and CTEs\n",
    "- 🔸 **Window functions** - ROW_NUMBER, RANK, SUM OVER, etc.\n",
    "- 🔸 **Built-in functions** - 200+ SQL functions available\n",
    "- 🔸 **User-defined functions** - Custom SQL functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use SQL vs DataFrame API:\n",
    "- 🔸 **Use SQL when**: Team prefers SQL, complex joins, reporting queries\n",
    "- 🔸 **Use DataFrame API when**: Programmatic logic, complex transformations, UDFs\n",
    "- 🔸 **Mix both when**: SQL for data access, DataFrame for processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Notes:\n",
    "- 🔸 **Same execution engine** - SQL and DataFrame API performance is identical\n",
    "- 🔸 **Catalyst optimization** - Both benefit from the same query optimizer\n",
    "- 🔸 **Choose based on preference** - Use what your team knows best\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Patterns:\n",
    "- 🔸 `spark.sql(\"SELECT ... FROM table\")` - Basic SQL query\n",
    "- 🔸 `df.createOrReplaceTempView(\"table\")` - Register DataFrame as table\n",
    "- 🔸 `spark.sql(\"CREATE TEMP VIEW view_name AS SELECT ...\")` - Create views\n",
    "- 🔸 `WITH cte_name AS (...) SELECT ... FROM cte_name` - CTE pattern\n",
    "- 🔸 `spark.sql(query).toPandas()` - Convert results to Pandas\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Temporary vs Global Views** - View management and persistence\n",
    "2. **SQL vs DataFrame API** - When to use each approach\n",
